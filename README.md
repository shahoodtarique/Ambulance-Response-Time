# Ambulance Response Time Optimization

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing ambulance response times through a Simul8-driven simulation model. The goal is to identify and address delays for critical C3 patients, emphasizing the roles of call operators and clinicians. The Simul8 model, incorporating a fleet of 1150 ambulances, provides insights into the challenges of meeting response time standards and suggests improvements.

## Key Features

- Simul8-driven ambulance response simulation
- Identification of delays for C3 patients
- Integration of call operators and clinicians' roles
- Evaluation of the impracticality of meeting response time standards with the existing fleet

## Technologies Used

- Simul8
- Data Analysis
- Simulation Modeling
